## Project
Alanine Scanning profile generator  

## Overview:
This is my effort to optimize the runtime speed of generating amino acid profiles.

I utilized concepts from "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen et al. (1989), particularly in the areas of heaps and sorting, along with insights from stack overflow and online Bioinformatics courses.
## Tool used: 
1. Perl switch.Perl <br>
(These files should be located in the directory: target sequence, reference sequence, and PDB file). 
2. Engaging in the random generation of alanine substitutions within a protein sequence.  
3. Runtime Complexity: O(N)

## Data:
Random mutation generator
